# Image Classification with TensorFlow
## Overview
This project aims to classify images using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from images and make predictions on their classes. The dataset is split into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Setup
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:
Clone or download the repository containing the project files.

## Usage
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script image_classification.py.
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the images, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
Optionally, you can tweak hyperparameters, model architecture, or preprocessing steps in the script to improve performance.
Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into different classes. It is split into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the model, respectively. Ensure the dataset is properly organized with images placed in corresponding class folders.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API. It typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. You can modify the architecture by adding or removing layers to suit your specific requirements.


## Training
Training the model involves optimizing the model's parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent. The training process iterates over the dataset multiple times (epochs) to improve the model's performance. Early stopping may be applied to prevent overfitting.


## Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on the validation set to assess its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn may be used to analyze the results.


## Deployment
Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed in production environments to classify new images. Deployment methods include saving the model's weights, using TensorFlow Serving, or converting it to TensorFlow Lite for mobile applications.
